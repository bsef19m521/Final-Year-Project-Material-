    "> In this example, the `GridSearchCV` class is used to perform a grid search over the values of the hyper-parameters defined in the param_grid dictionary. The fit method is used to train the logistic regression model on the training data, and the best_params_ attribute is used to print the best hyper-parameters found by the grid search. The model's performance is then evaluated on the test set using the score method.\n",
    "\n",
    "> You can use the `RandomizedSearchCV` class in a similar way to perform a random search for the best hyper-parameters of a logistic regression model. The main difference is that instead of specifying a grid of values for each hyper-parameter, you can specify a distribution from which the hyper-parameter values will be sampled randomly. This can be useful if you want to explore a larger range of hyper-parameter values, but don't want to specify every possible value."
